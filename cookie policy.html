        <h2>What is Cookie</h2>    
        <p>A cookie is a small file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. 
        The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. 
        Cookies can be used by web servers to identity and track users as they navigate different pages on a website and identify users returning to a website.
        Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.</p>

        <p>If you use the Tutorials Point, both Tutorials Point and third parties will use cookies to track and monitor some of your activities on and off the Tutorials Point website, and store and access some data about you, your browsing history, and your usage of the tutorialspoint.com website.</p>
        <p>We use both session cookies, which expire after a short time or when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which remain stored in your browser for a set period of time.
